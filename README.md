## Dynamic Distribution List Editor
This script was made to implement Dynamic Distribution Lists during my time at Conestoga Meats, and uses titles/departments/location of the office as variables to filter users. More conditions can be added in the listOfConditions variable.
You will need a valid Microsoft admin account for the organization you are trying to modify in order to use this script.
